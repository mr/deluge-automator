Allows uploading torrents automatically to a remote deluge client.

Planned to allow cleaning of torrents based on certain rules. Some of this is implemented, but not tested

Plan to have other options sent by command line

Eventually this will be deamonized in some way as well, maybe with systemd support, but that's a bit of a ways out.


---------------------------------------------------

Now supports a config file.

Config file usage:

Entries are of the format "key=value"

One key, value pair per line, extraneous lines are allowed, but not recommended. They will still be processed and will take up time and memory

Keys:

"host": Host of deluged
"port": Port of deluged
"username": Login username
"password": Login password
"monitordir": The directory that will be monitored for .torrent files

Example Config file:

host=somehost.com
port=1234
username=mrobinson7627
password=supersecretpassword
monitordir=/home/mrobinson7627/Downloads/
