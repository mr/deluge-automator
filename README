Allows uploading torrents automatically to a remote deluge client.

Planned to allow cleaning of torrents based on certain rules. Some of this is implemented, but not tested

Currently you have to modify the source to change "settings" (monitor location, client location, etc.). Planned to read from a config file. Other options can be set by command line

Eventually this will be deamonized in some way as well, maybe with systemd support, but that's a bit of a ways out.
