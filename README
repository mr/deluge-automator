Allows uploading torrents automatically to a remote deluge client.

Torrents can be cleaned according to tracker and amount completed. Currently, all other trackers than animebytes.es, bakabt.me, bitgameer.su (RIP), speed.cd, and what.cd are removed after completion. There are plans to add functionality to the config, but for now more can be added in the source.

---------------------------------------------------

Now supports a config file.

Config file usage:

Entries are of the format "key=value"

One key, value pair per line, extraneous lines are allowed, but not recommended. They will still be processed and will take up time and memory

Keys:

"host": Host of deluged
"port": Port of deluged
"username": Login username
"password": Login password
"monitordir": The directory that will be monitored for .torrent files

Example Config file:

host=somehost.com
port=1234
username=mrobinson7627
password=supersecretpassword
monitordir=/home/mrobinson7627/Downloads/

--------------------------------------------------

TODO
    Fix the bug that throws errors (critical)
    Allow adding other trackers via config
    Allow optionally downloading downloaded files (now *that's* abstraction) via FTP
